## Description

This React app demonstrates the Jarvis March and Kirkpatrick-Seidel algorithms for computing the convex hull of a set of points. The visualization leverages D3.js for rendering and animating the algorithms' execution, providing an interactive and educational experience.

## Technologies Used

- React
- D3.js
- Bootstrap & React-Bootstrap
- Framer Motion
- React Router DOM
